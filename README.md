# BCI-BASED-WEBSITE
This Website is the software implementation of BCI. 
Let's understand website parts one by one . 

## Home Page 
Welcome to our BCI - Website page! Our website explores the addition of EEG technology and embedded systems to create innovative applications that utilize brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), mini-games controlled by neural activity, and the analysis of facial expressions based on brain activity. 

## BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) Page 
BCI section introduce into the fascinating world of brain-computer interfaces. BCIs are systems that enable direct communication between the brain and external devices, opening up a ample amount of possibilities for the future. Here, we explain the core concepts of BCIs, how they function, and explore their future applications in various fields such as healthcare, gaming etc. 

## Mini Games Page
In the Mini Games section, we introduce our Ping Pong game. This game shows the practical application of EEG technology by allowing players to maneuver a virtual paddle using their neural activity. The player competes against a bot, and the paddle's movement is controlled by the player's mental commands to move it up and down. This game ot only provides entertainment but also demonstrates the application of using brain signals to control virtual objects. 


## Facial Expressions Page
Our Facial Expressions section focuses on the analysis and detection of emotions through EEG data. By capturing real-time EEG data, we can identify changes in brain activity associated with different emotions. Facial expressions are a result of the contraction and relaxation of minuscule muscles controlled by the brain. Our research data from Emotiv to detect and analyze these expressions. The processed data is streamed to our website using WebSockets.

## Founders Page 
Here, we feature the names and short bios of the individuals who contributed to making this project a reality added with their their professional backgrounds and expertise.
